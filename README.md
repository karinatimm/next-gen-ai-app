# **Next-Gen AI App**

**Next-Gen AI App** is a full-stack **AI-powered SaaS application** built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.  
It combines **OpenAI**, **Stripe subscriptions**, **Clerk authentication**, and **MongoDB** into a sleek, production-ready web app.

This project was designed to explore how modern AI tools can be integrated into real-world SaaS products - from **content generation** to **subscription monetization** - while keeping everything scalable, responsive, and developer-friendly.

## 🚨 Notes

> ⚠️ 📝 This is a portfolio/learning project created to explore modern AI integrations in web apps.
